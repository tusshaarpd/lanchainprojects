LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). 
It provides modular tools to connect LLMs with external data sources, integrate retrieval and reasoning capabilities, and build intelligent workflows.
LangChain is widely used for creating chatbots, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, automation tools, and evaluation platforms,making it easy for developers to prototype and deploy AI-powered solutions with flexible data access and logic integration.

1. Chatbot

A chatbot application leveraging LangChain allows users to interact with large language models in a conversational format. It supports context retention through conversation memory, delivering coherent and relevant responses. The application can integrate various LLMs and be deployed with a terminal or web UI for seamless user experiences.

2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

The RAG application extends chatbot capabilities by enabling question-answering over custom data like PDFs or documents. It combines semantic retrieval with LLM generation, allowing users to upload files and receive context-driven answers based on both model knowledge and the provided documents. This is ideal for building powerful search, knowledge extraction, or enterprise support tools.

3. LLM Evaluator

This application evaluates the quality of responses generated by different LLMs. Users upload a spreadsheet containing prompts and model outputs, and the system analyzes response accuracy, relevance, and overall performance. Evaluation results and feedback are displayed, helping teams benchmark and improve their language model configurations for production use.
